You may notice many packages you weren't expecting.  This is usually because of a bundled jar that references packages that don't apply.  You can usually remove these or if necessary, mark them as optional by adding ';resolution:=optional' to the package import.  Packages that are detected as version '0.0.0' usually mean either they are JDK packages or ones that aren't referenced in your project, and therefore, likely candidates for removal entirely.

Rome includes		a set of parsers and generators for the various flavors of feeds, as well as converters		to convert from one format to another. The parsers can give you back Java objects that		are either specific for the format you want to work with, or a generic normalized		SyndFeed object that lets you work on with the data without bothering about the		underlying format.
